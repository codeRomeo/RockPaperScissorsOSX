// ROCK * PAPER * SCISSORS
//
// Game play is self explanatory. In this MacOS implementation, user is presented with a window to choose rock, paper or scissors and plays against the computer.
// Score is kept for both players. User and compouter choices are displayed as left and right boxes; score displays below each.
// User picks their choice through three push buttons
//
// This is code version 0.2.0
// Comments added for every class, function and variable
