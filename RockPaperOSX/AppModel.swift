// ROCK * PAPER * SCISSORS
//
// Game play is self explanatory. In this MacOS implementation, user is presented with a window to choose rock, paper or scissors and plays against the computer.
// Score is kept for both players. User and compouter choices are displayed as left and right boxes; score displays below each.
// User picks their choice through three push buttons
//
// This is code version 0.2.0
// Comments added for every class, function and variable
//

class appModel {
    
//     This class is the model for "game logic" in the MVC pattern.
//     In theory, this source code can be ported to any platform without modification because its independent from either View or Controller.
//
//     properties :
//
//        appModel.userChoice is the input choice made by user between Rock, Paper or Scissors
//        appModel.computerChoice is the choice of Computer (gameBOT) randomized between Rock, Paper or Scissors
//        appModel.uiMessage - reserved for future updates
//        appModel.userScore - Score keeping for user
//        appModel.computerScore - Score keeping for computer
//
//     Methods:
//
//        appModel.play() - method (a function) that starts play on user input, determines winner and return winner message
//        appModel.compare - sub method and main game logic; compares two inputs and returns a winner according to traditional rules of Rock, Paper Scissors
//        appModel.randomizeRPS() - sub method; generates a random choice between Rock, Paper or Scissors for computer choice.
